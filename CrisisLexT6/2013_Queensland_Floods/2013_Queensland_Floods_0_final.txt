exactly how I felt when I got back from fiji
exactly right  it's means tested so only labour voters receive it.
exactly the same as what I thought it was too. sad of its true though
exactly! Damn it weather.
exactly. I'm not passing judgment till all the cards are on the table but if he did respect gone.
exactly. There is no excuse for it because it ruins family's and it hurts people. No one deserves that feeling.

far be it from me to judge but it's our duty to clean their teeth & feed them good nutrition

that's happened quite a few times this season. Can't think twice about it when we play Real.
that's how I feel
that's mothers for you ;) when you grow up you will see. I get embarrassed now for the way I've acted when I was younger
that's ok we can meet somewhere

that's pretty scary we live in slacks creek. Think we ok though.
that's really good to hear love
that's shit man! Ugh. You still have to come though xooxox
that's sickk. They are playing in Brisbane this weekend. Are you going to red hot chili peppers?
that's the spirit I like to see! Dead fowl walking! #Swan
that's to blatant there has to be some way of twist(lie) about him  the only footballer in the modern game to play for free and he .
that's what I wanted to see. Raw emotion. #truthwillsetyoufree

the 50th anniversary doesn't feel like it was 5 years ago
the Internet already judges me.
the PM is looking fresh... Are the glasses covering cosmetic changes?
the bitten person would need to survive the attack.
the body was found in the Oxley river. He got washed off motorbike in Greenbank. Pic of bridge
the casino also does  and white rabbit.
the fuck is dm?
the greens ones are dark mint chocolate :-) they are so dreaming addictive
the link isn't working - perhaps high traffic. Can you list suburbs in a tweet please.
the mask is actually a dog and it's scary
the news! Do you have power ? I'm hoping it comes back on tomorrow i have assignments haha!
the only thing you did wrong was leave the comments enabled on such a blog post.
the original of course! Better accessories!
the problem is every one of these guys has a woman telling him how much she loves it.
the questions asked by Lyndal attempted to give the govt get out of jail free card  shame!
the roof has buckled up the top of the building
the sweet sound of electricity!
the thing is we haven't tried to press them. Like when we play big teams away all we do is play counter.
the whole house was damp and yucky bu the end if it. The beach was INSANE a normally calm beach was crashing waves all the way up
the world is full of retards and they are all out to get me lately.
the worst part is she  like a lot of feminists  doesn't want equality  she wants to be first. It won't ever work that way.
then back to brisbane?
then its not a karaoke bar.
there are a lot of hottttt people in cairns. I can tell because they are all glistening with sweat
there is no one more fickle than
there is only 2 people in this world that can be bald but awesome and that's you and my grandfather
there is only one direction
there is something wrong with all of you...there I have said it :-)

there's like one person at my school and she likes linkin park and MCR but she also likes nickleback crie
there's some seriously  fkd up ppl out there.  Guessin even Mother Nature thinks ur so hot u need cooling down.
theres a few in Brisbane I think
they LOOK tall amd big though. unlike you  you adorable baby :3
they are very unique :-) that's the best thing about them
they blew all my hair off
they breed us tough up here! I did go to buy some water  not a bottle in sight!
they don't understand how boring they are that you need people like us
they look lovely  bet they taste great too!
they should almost re do it every half season. The colder climate is killing the pitches so quickly these days.
they should coz of generators... It'd probably be madness there tho if the suburb doesn't have power
they would be my choice too if I would have ventured out in this weather!
they're moving the entire pacific operations to Singapore #cheapasianlabour #fml
think I'm at 9. Few wasted dumb ones
