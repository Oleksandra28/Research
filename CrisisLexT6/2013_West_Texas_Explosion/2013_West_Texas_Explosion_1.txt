I feel like the people that are interested in just seeing Obama just shouldn't go. Don't forget the purpose of the memorial service.
So glad I went to the memorial today. The best thing wasn't seeing the president speak, but the videos of the legacy those men left.
I live right off the highway in Lacy-Lakeview/Waco &amp; all I hear are police &amp; EMS Sirens. My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/you responders as well.
@EvieJoeXO_: @marckiewalter I hope you&amp;' yours are safe&amp;' sound! I am girl thank you, it was 15 min away, but family &amp; friends are safe
