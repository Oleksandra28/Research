+1  What do they do with the zoo animals?
- Basically we do not have enough info to know if it is a good or bad decision.
- Calling him invisible would be an insult to invisible people everywhere
- Couldn't agree more. What a deplorable way to react to a crisis!
- Eakins makes a good point about having some familiarity with the coaches and players.
- Frankly that would leave a huge hole at centre in EDM.  Really do not see the Oil trading Gagner.
- How do you know what I do?
- I do not get the impression he gets overwhelmed easily.
- I think part of that was an overplay by the media though.
- I was trying to calm fans yesterday but I understand why some are getting antsy.  In reality can not be judged until Jul 31.
- It is June and new Mgmt.  The past problems does not mean we should be ridiculous.
- My experience has been that good things come in 2's...!   ;-)
- Oh I dunno about that boys. I think I'll just go to my friends wedding tomorrow instead. But y'all have fun!
- So did him being as ex-oiler have anything to do with it?
- Thanks.  I did not see the quote marks but I wanted to be sure.
- We should wait and here his rational.
- Why? This editorial certainly was not private.  Forgive me but I do not understand how something like this gets printed.
- Would rather have that than Mr. Dithers.
- You attacked the mayor for speaking his mind while defending freedom of the press.  Hypocritical.
- and no reporter has ever been ridiculous or wrote something they regretted;).  Not convinced but it does make sense.
- and when the mayor of Edmonton pulls advertising I am sure that will be funny too.
- but that is easier said than done.
- especially with silly season coming.
- if that offer was made than the trade would have happened already.
- just check the  timeline and you will see their only response to this is a defence of the comment.
- say what you want about Trayvon  but that gangsta had good taste in women. Daaaayam. #ZimmermanTrial
- terrible at trade proposals but would Hemsky  Gagner and the 7th be about right for Seguin?
- which time? He also said Clutterbuck to the Oilers was a possibility.
- working from home for a while. Heading into DT in a while
- yeah I think they would ask for Eberle.

I ordered a set there two years ago for my daughter  still in awesome shape!

I really need to get Netflix.
I really want someone to bring me a cold beverage..  Preferably with high alcohol content.. I think you'll like my payment plan;)
I really wish my laptop could run Shogun 2 properly. Shamefur dispray  computer.
I really wonder if Det. Serino would be so casual and nonchalant with a black male in the same scenario... I highly doubt it
I said it before but it's worth repeating: Best. Mayor. Ever.  #yycflood
I saw a notification from you an I knew exactly what it was going to say.
I saw you on TV. Thank you for standing in the front line when community had tough time.

I see what you did there...
I seriously just want to marry him  LOL
I should get ready so im all cute when he gets here but you know what NO
I should have a full car with me. Are you going to the Deerfoot complex?
I should have listened to my friends long ago!
I should tell anybody anything. No one keeps their mouth shut and no one tells the truth. Typical.
I should've fought a little harder  tried a little more  held on a little longer.
I shouldn't read anything without my glasses anymore.  Math = Meth and Magic Mouse = Magic Mike.
I smell bullshit from your last 6 tweets.
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out and if i wasn't high   i'd probably try to blow my brains out
I started 2 days ago I'm about to finish it!!!  I want that bitch dead how could she! ( Btw Don't spoil I'm not up to date)

I think . . . I might have ruined my life.
I think I have been very clear on this issue from the start.
I think I need another suitcase
I think I shall enjoy watching you die  writhing like the miserable little Askarian worm that you are...
I think I'd be loving and spoil my daughter and competitive and supportive of my son. #FutureDadOfTheYearAward? But in like 10 years though
I think I'm done chasing after u. It's hard 2 watch something u worked so hard for fall apart  but there's a time when u have to let it go.
I think I'm in love
I think I've had the same battery in my Sunrise pickup for a decade now.
I think a better alternative to #beyonce's song who run the world (girls) would be: Who run the world (Asians)
I think a nap is in order....
I think drivers that don't let pedestrians go are assholes .
